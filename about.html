<p> I am an emerging data scientist with a passion for sports and people. </p>


<p> I recently completed the <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis Data Science bootcamp </a> where I was able to develop by skills in Python, Sql, D3, and Git while building end-to-end data analysis pipelines (acquisition, storage, analysis, modeling, and visualizations).  I am currently an apprentice at Kaplan Test Prep where I am working on sales forecasting projects using time series analysis techniques.  </p>
